# Cryptography Experiments

This repository attempts to document my learning experiences with cryptography, via the website https://cryptopals.com/

Also serves as a good way for me to pick up Golang, so I'm doing it in Go!

## Challenges

Attempts can be found at `src/challengeN/main.go`

## Look at other writeups and approaches

Although I've completed some of the challenges, I need to look at how the others have attempted the harder ones (such as challenge 6) since my implementation is definitely not optimized
